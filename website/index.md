### Getting the code

You can get the code and this website by running:

    git clone http://git.blockchainbackpack.org/backpack.git/

This repository has a `website/` folder with this website and a `src/` folder which holds all the code. Instructions on how to build the proof of concept are in the top-level README.md file.

All the code is Apache 2.0 licensed, but this is just a proof of concept. If you actually want to build a full version of this system, you may want to start over with the described interface as a guideline.
