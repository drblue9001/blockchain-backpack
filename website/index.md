### Abstract

There have been many security and stability problems in the TF2 ecosystem over the last year. I propose moving the recording of ownership of high value items onto the Ethereum blockchain to prevent unauthorized transfer of items and to increase availability of item ownership data in a way that doesn't threaten the Valve item minting monopoly. I provide a proof of concept showing that this is possible.

### Disclaimer

While all the code is Apache 2.0 licensed, this isn't a real project; it is proof of concept to show that such a system is possible, and a sequence of blog posts showing why it is desirable.

If you actually want to build a full version of the system I'm outlining, I suggest that you actually throw away everything I've written (except maybe the interface outlined here), and start over.
