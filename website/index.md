### Abstract

As the economy in virtual items has grown in size and represents more real world money, theft and fraud have become rampant. By making use of [blockchain][] technology, game studios could secure their economies against these attacks. I provide a proof of concept using [Ethereum][] to partially record the state of the [Team Fortress 2][tf2] economy.

### Getting the code

You can get the code and this website by running:

    git clone http://git.blockchainbackpack.org/backpack.git/

This repository has a `website/` folder with this website and a `src/` folder which holds all the code. Instructions on how to build the proof of concept are in the toplevel README.md file.

All the code is Apache 2.0 licensed, but this is just a proof of concept. If you actually want to build a full version of this system, you may want to start over with the described interface as a guideline.
